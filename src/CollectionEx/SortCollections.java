    //There are two overloaded Collections.sort() methods, which are:

    //sort(List list): Sorts the elements of the List in ascending order of their natural ordering.
    //Ex: Read SecondLargest from CollectionsEx package

    //sort(List list, Comparator c): Sorts the elements of the list according to the order induced by the comparator.
    //Ex Read OrderByStdnt case from InterfaceEx package
